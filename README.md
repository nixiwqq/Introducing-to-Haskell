Welcome to the **Introducing to Haskell** repository! This project represents my exploration of functional programming concepts using **Haskell**, a language known for its strong type system, immutability, and elegant syntax.

This repository demonstrates my ability to:
- Learn and apply advanced programming paradigms.
- Write clean, maintainable, and bug-free code.
- Solve problems using functional programming techniques.

---

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates my:
- **Quick Learning Abilities**: I self-taught Haskell and implemented foundational concepts within a short timeframe.
- **Code Quality**: By leveraging Haskellâ€™s type system, I avoided common bugs and implemented concise, reliable solutions.
- **Adaptability**: Functional programming in Haskell is vastly different from imperative languages like Python or Java, showcasing my adaptability.

---

##  Project Structure
- **`src/`**: Main Haskell source files, showcasing examples like recursion, type classes, and pattern matching.
- **`exercises/`**: Hands-on problems for deepening understanding of functional programming.
- **`docs/`**: Learning notes and documentation for Haskell concepts.
- **`examples/`**: Fully implemented examples for reference, such as Fibonacci sequence and list manipulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)**: Version 9.0 or higher.
- **Cabal**: For building and managing Haskell projects.

Install them using:
```bash
# On macOS
brew install ghc cabal-install

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ghc cabal-install
